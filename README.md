### Introduction
    This is sample code for how to use the HMS wallet server interface. The HMS wallet server interface contains REST APIs for six types of passes (Loyalty Card, Offer, Gift Card, Boarding Pass, Transit Pass, Event Ticket).
    You can use these REST APIs to implement operations such as adding, querying or updating. Before you use this Demo, it's assumed that you already have a HUAWEI developer account and have already created an app to implement the
    HMS wallet kit. If you haven't, please refer to https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/start/10104 and https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-Connect/agc-create_app.

### Installation
    Before running the Demo code, you should have installed Java and Maven.

## Supported Environments
    Oracle Java 1.8 is recommended.

## Configuration 
    1. To run the sample code, you need to set the following configuration values in the "src\test\resources\release.config.properties" file.

        1). "gw.appid" and "gw.appid.secret":
        To implement the HMS wallet kit to an app, "gw.appid" and "gw.appid.secret" are this app's "App ID" and "App secret" on the HUAWEI AppGallery Connect website.

        2). "gw.tokenUrl":
        This is the address to obtain a REST API authentication token. Get it from the "HMS Wallet Server Demo Development Tutorial" file on https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Examples/wallet-example.

        3). "walletServerBaseUrl":
        Set this value depending on the wallet server's location. Get it from https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-References/wallet-api-server-address.

    2. After you set all the configurations values, compile the Demo as a Maven project.

    3. Then copy the "config/hmspass" directory to the "target/classes" directory. Now you can start to test example methods in the Demo code.

    5. Refer to https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Guides/wallet-preparations to apply for a service for one of the six passes. Please note that the "Service ID" of your service is actually the
    "passStyleIdentifier" you will use in the Demo code (in JSON files). Then you can test sample methods for the corresponding pass. Apply for other services before you test other passes.
